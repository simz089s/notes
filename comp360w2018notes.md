## Introduction

https://cs.mcgill.ca/~hatami/comp360-W2018/

## Basics

- ...COMP 250, COMP 251
- Summations

> How many digits are in the binary expansion of _n_?
- roundUp(log_2 n)

`n = 5 => n = binary{1 * 1}`

> ... "Il manque déjà des notes"
- Elvric

~~~
S = (a1, a2, ..., an) a seq of int

E is the set of even numbers in {1, ..., n}

A = SUM_{i in E}(ai)

S = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4)
n = 5

A = ?  =  SUM__{i in 2,4}(ai)  =  ...

OK I give up t'as gagné Elvric
I hate taking algorithm notes on computer
